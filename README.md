MichelinChef provides a timed delivery of cooking instructions for chefs avoiding the need for manually interacting with the recipe while cooking it

Cooking instructions are provided by Cards (CardView). The chef is able to see a review screen containing all the ingredients and other relevant info for each recipe. The cards are timed automatically thereby not requiring the chef to touch the device while cooking (thereby preventing smudges)

This was done for a course project @ TAMU and arose due to limitatons in current cooking instructions media such as static web pages, video, recipes on paper etc...
