\section{Conclusion}

Cooking is an integral part of a person's life and it is folk-wisdom that the best way to reach a man's heart is through his stomach. But cooking becomes a challenging task if the user is inexperienced or when trying new recipes. We conducted a short survey of existing recipe delivery mechanisms and found that they're clumsy and not ideal solution for cooking. Most of these mechanisms require human intervention to get through each and every step of the recipe - this would make each of them very inconvenient to use. 

We solved this problem by providing a new mechanism of recipe delivery - digital cards. A card is shown for each step of the recipe and the card contains instructions as to what that step is and an image accompanying the outcome of that step. Each card has a timer which counts down and on expiry the card moves on to the next card containing the next step of the recipe. This automatic navigation to different steps makes MichelinCook a very convenient tool to use in one's kitchen. Our evaluation techniques have also confirmed our hypothesis and we plan to release the application on the Android Play Store very soon.
